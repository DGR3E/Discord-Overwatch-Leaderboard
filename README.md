This is a projet in wich I aim to learn JavaScript while making a useful bot
for the discord app. I'm using node.js with discord.js.

There must be a file named "botconfig.json" wich includes the token and the
prefix. Something like this:

```json
{
  "token": "yourwonderfultoken",
  "prefix": "anytingyouwantbeforethecomands"
}
```

# How To
Download this repository. Install node (this is tested with 8.11.3) and npm. Then use on a terminal, in the bot folder:

`npm install`

Create the botconfig.json as shown before in this document.

Then, for starting the bot use:

`node index.js`

### Disclaimer
This is just a little project, probably there are errors. The data is not protected in any way, its just in a json file in the bot folder. If I can get a way to host the bot I'll post here a link to add it to your server, until then, you have to host it. THE BOT ONLY WORKS IN 1 SERVER, in more than 1 is not tested and not intended to work at all.
